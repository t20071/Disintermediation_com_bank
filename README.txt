There are two scripts to run the model.

(1) MODEL.m
(2) MODEL_Counterfactual.m

The first of these two scripts allows the user to run the model for one parameter set. The second allows running the model for a sequence of parameter settings in one simulation round. The details concerning which parameters can be changed to that end is provided inside the script. 

The estimation scripts are not included in this script package. They are available from the authors on request.
